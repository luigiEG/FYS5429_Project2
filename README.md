# Cosmological matter density field emulator with CVAE
Authors: Marta Corioni, Luigi Ernesto Ghezzer

This is the repository relative to the second project for the course FYS5429 at UiO 
## Abstract:
Quick generation of mock data is essential for analysis and understanding of large-scale structures in the universe. Machine learning techniques have gained attention in cosmology for their
ability to replace traditional emulation methods that aims to approximate the behavior of complex simulations using simplified models. In this work we will explore Variational Autoencoders as a method to generate cosmological matter density field.
